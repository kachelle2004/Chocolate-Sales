# Chocolate-Sales
Analyze the sales of different chocolate types and, from the dataset, identify the trends between each salesperson, country, and chocolate type that are popular worldwide.

In this project:
I use python to:
1)EDA
2) simple data visualization

For most data visualization  for this project:
I use Tableau to show the relations that can be found in this link:

# From this dataset i found out the following relations:
1) Top Sales person across countries is Chess Bonnell who sold about 1.02M followed by Oby Sorre who sold about 1.01M.
2) Austraila generated the most sales at 3.64M followed by Uk at 3.36M and India at 3.34M.
3) Despite having the TOP 3 have the most sales in chocolate, various people have different favourite types of chocolate. Australia's top favourite is 40% Dark Bites, Uk's favourite is  Smoooth Silky Salty, and India's favorite is Eclairs

# Assumption while processing this dataset:
1)Despite the amount being in USD, salespeople are charging various prices for the chocolate. This is likely due to country-specific import taxes and personal commissions.
2) Assuming that the chocolate was sold and manufactured by the same origin, the person  who sold to the US is  the same as those who sold to Indian customers and other parts of the world.
3) The chocolates have the same expired date and do not have any discount or sales that resulted in the sales of various persons sold in the same area at a different prices.


# Original of the dataset.
